# React Native app + typescript + redux. What can go wrong?

Getting started with `react-native` gives you some work to catch up with its concepts and framework (especially to those that have been working in iOS, Windows and Android natively for a long time... like me) and to complicate things a bit more, everybody tells you to check out [`redux`](http://redux.js.org/) (including [facebook](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/releases/0.49/docs/more-resources.html#development-tools)).

So, this is my head dive into `redux`.

## Where to start?

Installing the modules for your application to use. Interestingly enough, `redux-thunk` had already its type definition.
